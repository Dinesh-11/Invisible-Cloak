# Invisible-Cloak
Introduction to OpenCv

Creat a Invisible cloak application using Python and OpenCV.
i.e  Implementing Harry potter invisible cloth effect using Python.

While recording or accessing webcam, keep the scene blank 
i.e let there be only background for 3-4 seconds later enter the scene with your cloth.

To access webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

Works well with red color.
To implement different color, adjust the HSV value.
